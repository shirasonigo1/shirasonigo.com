Crafted from upcycled bicycle inner tubes sourced from local bike shops, the Inner Shoe is designed for walking comfortably on rocky beaches. 

## Slider 1: 


Using an innovative construction method, we preserve the natural integrity of the rubberâ€”without 
re-vulcanization, cutting, or harmful glues. 
This process minimizes exposure to toxic particles while allowing you to enjoy the pure strength and flexibility of high-quality natural rubber. Durable, water-resistant, and eco-friendly, the Inner Shoe redefines sustainable footwear.

## Slider 2:

For this individual project for the IDE SuperGreen module, I decided to design a shoe using upcycled bicycle inner tubes. As a cyclist myself, I frequently noticed this waste material in bike shops. Bicycle inner tubes are made from natural pure rubber, which is non-biodegradable. My goal was to repurpose this material in its existing form, experiment with its unique structure, and build upon it.
