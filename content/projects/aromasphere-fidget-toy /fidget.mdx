Fidget toy is typically a small object used for a pleasant but purposeless activity with the hands. When someone begins to
fidget, they are experiencing pent-up energy, and their body needs to release it in one way or another.
The act of fidgeting, such as drumming your fingers or spinning a pen, allows your brain to focus on something
subconsciously, thereby reducing stress.

As a software engineer, I found the profession to be stressful, often catching myself fidgeting. Whether playing with the
jewelry I'm wearing or my favorite pastime of taking the key in and out from my keychain, I realized the therapeutic effect of
fidgeting. Over the years, I've collected various fidget toys like spinners and infinity cubes and became a fan.

In this project, I decided to create my own fidget toy. Since I frequently use essential oils to focus or relax, I pondered how to
combine them with a fidget toy. After researching, I discovered that lava stones absorb essential oils. Inspired by the act of
using a keychain, I designed a fidget toy to activate the touch and smell senses. When you play with it, you gently release the
scent into the air, allowing you to both fidget and relax simultaneously
