The mailboxes are like a chapter in the community book, recording the lives of those who resided there, and those who
briefly came, returned, or disappeared. Others emerged, bringing with them a new verbal composition from a different
generation.



## Slider 1: 

I embarked on this project while searching for inspiration in the streets
near my house. I yearned for a new piece of history, something that
could narrate a compelling story and evoke excitement within me.
During one of my favorite strolls in the neighborhood, I came across an
old mailbox that caught my eye. I decided to capture it in a photograph,
initially without giving it much thought. However, curiosity gripped me,
and the next day, I unintentionally began photographing every mailbox I
encountered along the streets. Upon returning from work that day, I
randomly chose one of the pictures and started drawing it with pencils.
For many years, I hadn't given much consideration to my mailbox. Yet,
this project compelled me to ponder the lives of those who lived here,
contemplating the mail they received, the shapes of the papers, and the
volume of correspondence within the mailbox. Each element told a
unique storyâ€”a narrative of extreme emotions, from love letters to
messages about the loss of a loved one or college acceptances.


## Slider 2 :  

In this work, I decided to focus on the paper in the mailbox and its
folded shapes. Utilizing the play of light on white paper, I aim to tell a
story about paper and emotions. I invite you to explore the nuanced
emotions encapsulated within each piece of paper and the memories
they hold.
