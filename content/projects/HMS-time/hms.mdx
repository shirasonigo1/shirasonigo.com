This is the final project for the IDE Cyber-Physical Systems course at Imperial. 
I collaborated on this project with Carrie Rong and Moin Mulla. 

## Slider 1: 



The pendulum clock has long captured the passage of time in hours, minutes, and seconds with its steady rhythmic swing. Inspired by the intricate mechanics of clockwork and fascinated by the nature of time perception, we set out to play with an idea of time that transcends the mechanical. Instead of being represented through the ticking of a traditional clock that persists in the background, what if we had the ability to shape and guide our own experience of time?

## Slider 2:

Our project, HMS Time, reimagines the abstract notion of time as not only something ticking down, but a medium to be felt and navigated through. Its sculptural shape takes the form of a ship, motored by a set of gears, and invites kinetic interaction through a webcam that detects body position. Audience members manipulate the motion of the ship and gears by forming their arms into the 12, 3, and 9 o'clock positions, thus becoming the clock with their own bodies.
