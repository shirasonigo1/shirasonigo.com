In the heart of my journey lies the inspiration drawn from the hands that shape
our world. These hands belong to the artisans, the craftsmen, the ones whose
trades tell stories of the past and bear witness to the evolution of our
surroundings.

In this work, I sought to immortalize the essence of a disappearing era.
In the face of inevitable change, these hands, weathered by time and
experience, carry a profound connection to the very fabric of the community I
call home.

As the sands of time threaten to bury the crafts of yesteryear, “clayful hands
edition” becomes a vessel, carrying the memories of these artisans into the
future.

Beyond the ticking of clocks, this work aspires to inspire the next generation,
ensuring that the wisdom and spirit of these skilled hands live on. Even as the
role of a clock fixer fades into obscurity, the lessons learned from their timeless
mastery will echo in the hearts and hands of those who follow.
