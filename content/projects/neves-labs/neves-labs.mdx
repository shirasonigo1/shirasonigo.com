üåç Rethinking Family and Society in 2050 üå±
What if family structures could evolve beyond today‚Äôs norms? What if we could compress generations and create new family bonds using cutting-edge science?

## Slider 1: 


Introducing Neves Labs:
As part of a transdisciplinary team project, we‚Äôve envisioned a future European Exo-city‚Äîa ‚Äúmegacity‚Äù merging the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France. This speculative world grapples with challenges like population growth, rising living costs, and reimagining what "family" means in an increasingly urbanized society.
## Slider 2 :  
Our Exploration:
We examined population growth rates in megacities and the financial strain of raising children for families.
We reflected on commune movements of the past, like those in Britain and Denmark, where children were raised collectively to challenge the nuclear family model.

- We asked a provocative question: What if people could have more than two biological parents?

## Slider 2: 

The Role of Science:
Neves Labs is a fictional biotech company pioneering In Vitro Gametogenesis, enabling the creation of reproductive material from almost any somatic cell. Using this with a "generation-skipping" technique, Neves Labs imagines a radical concept:
- A child biologically related to every member of a group, compressing an entire family tree into a single generation.
